\title{Fitting regression model via structural transformation model}
\usage{
trReg(formula, data, subset, tFun = "linear", method = c("kendall",
  "adjust"), B = 0, control = list())
}
\arguments{
\item{formula}{a formula expression, of the form \code{response ~ predictors}.
The \code{response} is assumed to be a \code{survival::Surv} object with both left truncation and right censoring.
When there is no covariates, e.g., when the right hand side of the formula is \code{~ 1}, the \code{trReg()} function returns a \code{trSurvfit} object.
See \code{?survival::Surv} for more details.}

\item{data}{an optional data.frame in which to interpret the variables occurring
in the \code{formula}.}

\item{subset}{an optional vector specifying a subset of observations to be used in the fitting process.}

\item{tFun}{a character string specifying the transformation function or a user specified function indicating the relationship between X, T, and a.
When \code{tFun} is a character, the following are permitted:
\describe{
  \item{linear}{linear transformation structure,}
  \item{log}{log-linear transformation structure,}
  \item{exp}{exponential transformation structure.}
}}

\item{method}{a character string specifying how the transformation parameter is estimated. The available options are \code{"kendall"} and \code{"adjust"}. See \bold{Details}.}

\item{B}{a numerical value specifies the bootstrap size for estimating the standard error.
When \code{B = 0} (default), the bootstrap standard errors will not be computed.}

\item{control}{a list of control parameters. The following arguments are allowed:
\describe{
  \item{\code{lower}}{The lower bound to search for the transformation parameter; default at -1.}
  \item{\code{upper}}{The upper bound to search for the transformation parameter; default at 20.}
  \item{\code{tol}}{The tolerance used in the search for the transformation parameter; default at 0.01.}
  \item{\code{G}}{The number of grids used in the search for the transformation parameter; default is 50.
A smaller \code{G} could results in faster search, but might be inaccurate.}
  \item{\code{Q}}{The number of cutpoints for the truncation time used when \code{method = "adjust"}. The default is 0.}
  \item{\code{parallel}}{an logical value indicating whether parallel computation will be applied when \code{B} is not 0.}
  \item{\code{parCl}}{an integer value specifying the number of CPU cores to be used when \code{parallel = TRUE}.
The default value is half the CPU cores on the current host.}
}}

\description{
\code{trReg} fits transformation model under dependent truncation and independent censoring via a structural transformation model.
}
\details{
The main assumption on the structural transformation model is that it assumes there is a latent, quasi-independent truncation time
that is associated with the observed dependent truncation time, the event time, and an unknown dependence parameter
through a specified funciton.
The structure of the transformation model is of the form:
\deqn{h(U) = (1 + a)^{-1} \times (h(T) + ah(X)),} where \eqn{T} is the truncation time, \eqn{X} is the observed failure time,
\eqn{U} is the transformed truncation time that is quasi-independent from \eqn{X} and \eqn{h(\cdot)} is a monotonic transformation function.
The condition, \eqn{T < X}, is assumed to be satisfied.
The quasi-independent truncation time, \eqn{U}, is obtained by inverting the test for quasi-independence by one of the following methods:
\describe{
  \item{\code{method = "kendall"}}{ by minimizing the absolute value of the restricted inverse probability weighted Kendall's tau or maximize the corresponding \eqn{p}-value.
This is the same procedure used in the \code{trSUrvfit()} function.}
  \item{\code{method = "adjust"}}{ includes a function of latent truncation time, \eqn{U}, as a covariate.
  A piece-wise function is constructed based on \code{Q+1} indicator functions on whether \eqn{U} falls in the \eqn{Q}th and the (\eqn{Q+1})th percentile,
  where \eqn{Q} is the number of cutpoints used. See \code{control} for details. 
  The transformation parameter, \eqn{a}, is then chosen to minimize the significance of the coefficient parameter.}}
